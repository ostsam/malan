For example:  \n• Where do you work?  \n• What are your main tasks?  \n• How do you feel about it?\n\nNew words you might find useful:  \n• occupation (your line of work)  \n• routine (your daily schedule)  \n• tasks (the things you have to do)\n\nGo ahead—I’d love to hear about what you do each day!",
